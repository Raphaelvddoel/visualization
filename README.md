# VizTech
VizTech visualizes the data set "Great Britain Road Safety Data" from 2018 with a focus on road classes. 
## Usage
go to [raphaelvddoel.github.io/visualization](https://raphaelvddoel.github.io/visualization) or download this repository and open index.html. An internet connection is required when running the code locally.

After having loaded the visualization tool, multiple charts appear. A color selector can be used to change the colors in which the charts are encoded. This ensures that e.g. red-blind users can still use this tool.

Users are able to interact with VizTech by choosing their preferred idiom for the side charts. Furthermore, users are able to further specify the data shown by clicking on a road class in the default chart (right-top chart).
